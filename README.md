A huge online departmental store have a myriad of grocery items at their godown. All items must be listed on the website, along with their quantities and prices.
Users must be able to sign up and purchase groceries. The system should present him with delivery slot options, and the user must be able to choose his preferred slot. Users must then be taken to the payment page where he makes the payment with his favourite method. 

Additional features could include parts recommendation engines, vehicle fitment lookup, custom packaging, loyalty programs, and auto-replenishment. The focus is on providing automotive parts buyers with an intuitive, tailored e-commerce experience.

The app can include cuisine browsing, personalized recommendations, ratings/reviews, and dish photos. Restaurants manage menus, availability, pricing, and order processing through a dashboard. Customers can save delivery addresses, payment methods, and favourite/recent orders.

The primary challenge assigned to me was the development and debugging of a Grocery Delivery Application, which required:

•	A robust frontend architecture with ReactJS and TypeScript.

•	Proper management of cart state using hooks and context providers.

•	Resolving build errors caused by incorrect JSX syntax and TypeScript configuration.

•	Ensuring seamless component integration, file naming conventions, and maintainable code structure.

This problem allowed me to simulate real industrial scenarios, where complex applications may fail to build or run due to configuration or syntactical issues, requiring systematic debugging and holistic problem-solving.
